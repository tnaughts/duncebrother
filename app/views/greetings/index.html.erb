                    <p>The 5th anniversary of the Dunce Brother will focus heavily on spiritual awakening and a deeper understanding of the self. This will require getting into a boat and voyaging the heavy seas of Lake Michigan with JB at the helm.</p>

                      Water, earth, wind, and fire will play a prominent role in Dunce Brother V. The voyage will transcend the game of golf and it is our aim that each participant will be a more grounded human post Dunce.
